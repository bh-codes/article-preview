## My process

Mobile first layout.
Created two separate author/share containers so that each viewport doesn't interfere with eachother. I'm sure there is an easier, less redundant way to do this, but as a newbie, this is what I created.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Speech/text bubbles are layers. Cool to see one container and an ::after on CSS come together to create it. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

Need to read more upon creating a better way to create different actions for different viewports for the same containers.
